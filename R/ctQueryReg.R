#' Function to parse from a character vector all character matching all keywords from a query.
#' 
#' @param query character or character vector.
#' @param db a character vector to parse query from. If remakedb=FALSE it should be a matrix with each extracted word of db as second column and with corresonding full character of db as first column.
#' @param remakedb a boolean value, default is TRUE. Put to FALSE (you should not do this) if you can provide a matrix as db as describe in db parameter.  
#' @return a character vector with all matches for one query.
#' @details 
#' This function will look for matches between a query and a character database using regular expression for text mining.
#' This function is not perfect and require some good practices:
#' - Take look at your database to design your query.
#' - Include both litteral and acronym form (if it exist) of a term in distinct query character.
#' - Avoid using plural forms in query.
#' - Correclty spell your query.
#' - Database will not always be clean, and concatenated words (for instance: forinstance)
#' will not be detected but with a specific corresponding concatened query.
